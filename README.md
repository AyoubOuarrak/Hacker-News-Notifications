##Why
I'm a big fan of Hacker News and status bar Applications. I spend hours scrolling in the HN web site to find some interesting story and recently I found these nice [API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), so I thought, instead of scrolling why not create a status bar app that automatically show me (nicely) a random story from hacker news

##How
Just API calls and some JSON manipolation. 100% native code in Swift.

##Required
Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11  

##Usage
There is just an icon in the status bar where you can quit the app, update the top stories and configure the app. In the notification center you can find all the stories.
